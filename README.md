1. Composition VS Aggregation:  
A "owns" B = Composition : B has no meaning or purpose in the system without A  
A "uses" B = Aggregation : B exists independently (conceptually) from A  
Example:  
A Company is an aggregation of People. A Company is a composition of Accounts. When a Company ceases to do business its Accounts cease to exist but its People continue to exist.  
2. Association:  
Association just means A and B has relationships
